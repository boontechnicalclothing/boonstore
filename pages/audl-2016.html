<p>2016 is going to be an exciting year for Boon and professional Ultimate as we gear up for another season with AUDL!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://theaudl.com/articles/ata/BoonTechPartnership2016" target="_blank">theaudl.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For the second consecutive season, Boon Technical Clothing will operate as the official jersey supplier for all 26 AUDL teams. Specializing in customizable performance-based activewear, Boon is set to upgrade its production process in 2016 while continuing to provide low-cost, high-quality athletic clothing.</p>

<p>“One of our goals as a company for 2016 is to improve all of our products,” said USA Operations Manager John Larracas. “That means investing more time and effort on product development and customer service to make sure customers have a lasting experience from inquiry to receiving their orders.”</p>

<p>What began in 2007 as a two-man operation between founder Aldwin Ibanez and a single seamstress, Boon has grown into an international sportswear presence in the past two years. A former national team caliber climber, Ibanez struggled to stay at peak performance due to increasing cost demands and a lack of sponsorships to help offset those costs. Ibanez’s experience as an ambitious athlete without much financial support helped him create a business in Boon that strives to provide top quality sports apparel at a price any participant can afford.</p>

<p>“The company wanted to break the notion that if a jersey is made with excellent quality, then it must be expensive,” Larracas said in an interview with Get Horizontal earlier this year.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Philippines-based company decided to expand operations to better align itself as an international brand in the ultimate community. Larracas directed Boon’s creation of an office in California to meet the increased demand for their products in the United States.</p>

<p>“Having a presence in California added new dimension in the structure of our international merchandising market,” Larracas said. “It has been instrumental in our collaborative efforts to expand the game internationally.”</p>

<p>The investments Boon has made to grow their own company — as well as to promote the sport at large across all divisions — made them a natural ally and partner for the AUDL.</p>

<p>“We ask a lot of our official uniform supplier - we need nearly 800 player kits delivered in a two month window to ensure that all teams are ready for opening day. This includes any last minute additions or alterations,” said AUDL Commissioner Steve Gordon. “In 2015 Boon met and exceeded all of our expectations. Not only do they help our business, they are devout ambassadors for the game of ultimate we want to see. We are happy to have them back for a second year.”</p>

<p>And for Boon and its employees, that happiness is shared.</p>

<p>“The partnership with the AUDL has been a huge impact to our company,” Larracas said.</p>

<p>“To see [players and fans] wear it on and off field makes the whole experience.”</p></blockquote>

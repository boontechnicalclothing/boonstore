		<div class="col-md-6">
			<p><strong>It all started with a passion for sports.</strong></p>
			
			<p>Being a climber and an ultimate frisbee player, Boon came up with a sports apparel line not just to provide color and clothing that would make players look good in their respective fields, but to give them a brand more than willing to make premium, full-sublimated jerseys available at highly competitive prices.</p>

			<p>The philosophy is simple: Everyone should be able to wear quality sports apparel at a friendly price-point. Boon wanted to break the notion that if a jersey is made with excellent quality, then it must be expensive.	</p>

			<p><strong>What Makes Boon Different?</strong></p>
			<p>What gives Boon an edge is the construction of each and every jersey. All jerseys should pass the Boon standard before they get sent out to each player or team. This is the Boon Advantage.</p>
